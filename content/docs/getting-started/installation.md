# Installation

## Prerequisites <Badge type="danger" text="Important!" />

To use NativeScript-Vue, your system needs to be set up to be able to compile and run native apps.

A detailed guide can be found in the NativeScript docs: [Environment Setup](https://docs.nativescript.org/setup/)

## Creating a project

Once you have your system ready, create a new NativeScript-Vue project using the NativeScript CLI:

```bash
ns create myAwesomeApp --template @nativescript-vue/template-blank@rc

cd myAwesomeApp
ns run ios|android
```
