### Does it work with Vue 3 or the Composition API?

Yes! Since **3.0**, Vue 3 is supported. You can use both the Options and the Composition API per your preference.

### What is NativeScript-Vue?

**tl;dr** it's a custom renderer for Vue that renders to NativeScript views.

### Does it run inside a WebView?

No, it runs your JavaScript/Vue code in an embedded JavaScript runtime (using V8, the engine powering Node.js, Chromium-based browsers, Cloudflare workers and more...) that exposes bindings to all native APIs automatically (discovered at build-time).

### So the user interface is native?

Yes, all `<template>` blocks are rendered via NativeScript Views. These views are responsible for instantiating and translating attributes and CSS styling to their native equivalents. ie. `<Label text="Hello World">` will render a `UILabel` on iOS and an `android.widget.TextView` on Android.

### Am I limited to elements provided by NativeScript-Vue?

No, both NativeScript and NativeScript-Vue are built in a way that it's easy for plugins (or your own code) to register new elements. For example, you can install any 3rd party (ui) library and expose it to your `<template>` blocks. The majority of NativeScript plugins do just that: wrap native libraries under a common api for easy consumption.

### ... I'm stuck, where do I get help?

Learning a new technology always has it's challenges. The [NativeScript Community Discord](https://nativescript.org/discord) is the best place to ask for help.

### Who's behind this?

NativeScript-Vue is primarily maintained by [@rigor789](https://github.com/rigor789) with various amazing [contributors from the community](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue/graphs/contributors).
